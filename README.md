# FacialKeyPoint-Detector
  In this project i try to detect facial keypoint from a face. i have able to detect left eye, right eye , nose and mouth from an image. I utilize a dataset from kaggle-dataset, which have 29 features of an image to detect above keypoints of an images. I implemented convolutional neural network (CNN) concept in this project. I manipulated Tensorflow API to implement CNN concept.
